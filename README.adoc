# This is a sample (PoC) Olingo / Play integration

## Intro
This is a sample (PoC) link:http://apache.olingo.org[Olingo] / Play integration.

Therefore the `TecSvc` from the Olingo was copied (see all below `app/olingo/*`)
and a `PlayODataHanlder` and according `Application` was created (see below `app/controllers/*`).

As disclaimer, this is just a *PoC* and not a *best practice* project.


## Run

Start with `activator run` and open `http://localhost:9000/`.
Or directly `http://localhost:9000/odata.svc/ESAllPrim?$format=json`.
